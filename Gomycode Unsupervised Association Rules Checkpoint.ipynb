    "\n",
    "Top Products: The analysis reveals that products like burgers, cake, chicken, chocolate, cookies, and eggs have the highest support values. This indicates that these items are frequently purchased by customers. Mineral Water: Mineral water appears to be a staple item, as it has the highest support (23.83%) and is often purchased alongside various other products. Association Rules:\n",
    "\n",
    "Chocolate and Mineral Water: The association between chocolate and mineral water is strong, with a lift of 1.35, suggesting that customers who buy chocolate are likely to purchase mineral water as well. Eggs and Mineral Water: Eggs also have a significant association with mineral water, which could indicate that customers prefer to buy these items together. Spaghetti and Mineral Water: There is a similar trend with spaghetti, which indicates that meal-related items are often bought with mineral water. Customer Preferences:\n",
    "\n",
    "There is a clear indication that products with higher purchase frequency (like eggs, chocolate, and mineral water) drive customer choices and can be leveraged in marketing strategies. Business Plan Suggestions Product Placement Strategy:\n",
    "\n",
    "Cross-Merchandising: Position chocolate, eggs, and spaghetti near mineral water displays. Use attractive signage that suggests pairing these items, promoting convenience for customers who often buy them together. End-Cap Displays: Create themed displays at the ends of aisles featuring popular item combinations, like chocolate and mineral water, to draw attention and boost impulse buying. Promotions and Discounts:\n",
    "\n",
    "Bundle Offers: Develop promotional bundles that combine frequently purchased items (e.g., eggs, mineral water, and chocolate).\n",
    "Offering a discount for purchasing these items together can encourage larger basket sizes. Loyalty Program: Implement a loyalty program that rewards customers for purchasing frequently bought items. For instance, buying chocolate and mineral water together could earn points for discounts on future purchases. Product Assortment:\n",
    "\n",
    "Expand Product Range: Based on the data, consider expanding the variety of products in high-support categories like snacks (cookies, chocolate) and beverages (mineral water) to cater to diverse customer preferences. Healthier Alternatives: Introduce healthy options or organic alternatives for popular items like chocolate and snacks to cater to health-conscious consumers, aligning with current trends. Marketing Campaigns:\n",
    "\n",
    "Targeted Marketing: Utilize data insights to create targeted marketing campaigns that emphasize the benefits of pairing products (e.g., healthy meals with mineral water). Seasonal Promotions: Align promotions with seasonal trends, focusing on high-demand items (like chocolate during holidays) to maximize sales during peak times. In-Store Events:\n",
    "\n",
    "Sampling Events: Host tasting events or cooking demonstrations featuring recipes that incorporate popular items like eggs, spaghetti, and chocolate, promoting their usage together. Customer Engagement: Create engaging content on social media that highlights meal ideas or snack pairings, directing customers to in-store displays for those products. Feedback Mechanism:\n",
    "\n",
    "Customer Surveys: Implement regular customer feedback surveys to refine product offerings and discover new customer preferences or shopping habits, ensuring that inventory aligns with demand."
