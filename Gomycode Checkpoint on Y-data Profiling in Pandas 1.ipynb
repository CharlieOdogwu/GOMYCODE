    "    - 3. Display general information about the dataset.\n",
    "    - 4. Run descriptive analysis on the dataset using the 'describe' function.\n",
    "- Step 2: Data exploration with ydata-profiling\n",
    "    - 1. Use ydata-profiling to generate a report of the provided dataset.\n",
    "    - 2. Look for missing values in the dataset. You can use the report generated by ydata to identify missing values.\n",
    "    - 3.Examine the correlations between different columns in the dataset. You can use the report generated by ydata to identify correlations.\n",
    "    - 4. Identify any other interesting patterns or insights in the dataset that you can discover through the ydata-profiling report.\n",
    "- Step 3: Summary\n",
    "    - Write a summary of your findings based on the ydata-profiling report. Be sure to include any interesting patterns or insights you discovered in the dataset."
