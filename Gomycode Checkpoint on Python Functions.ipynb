    "### What You're Aiming For\n",
    "\n",
    "- Create a calculator program that allows the user to perform mathematical operations on two numbers using basic functions and a dictionary to store the operations. The program should also have the ability to continue calculations with the result of previous calculations.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Instructions\n",
    "\n",
    "- Create four basic mathematical functions: 'add', 'subtract', 'multiply', and 'divide' that take in two numbers and return the result of the operation.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Create a dictionary 'operations' that assigns the functions to their corresponding operation symbols.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Create a function 'calculator' that prompts the user to input the first number.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Use a for loop to print the available operation symbols.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Create a while loop that will continue to run until the user chooses to end the current calculation.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Inside the while loop, prompt the user to select an operation symbol.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Prompt the user to input the second number.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Use the dictionary to retrieve the function that corresponds to the selected operation symbol and store it in a variable 'calculation_function'\n",
    "\n",
    "- Perform the calculation by calling the 'calculation_function' on the two input numbers and store the result in a variable 'answer'.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Print the equation and the result of the calculation.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Ask the user if they would like to continue using the result as the first number for further calculations.\n",
    "\n",
    "- If the user chooses to continue, update the 'num1' variable to the value of 'answer'.\n",
    "\n",
    "- If the user chooses to start a new calculation, set the 'should_continue' variable to false and call the 'calculator' function to start a new calculation.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Note: Make sure to test the program with different inputs and operations to ensure that it is functioning properly."
